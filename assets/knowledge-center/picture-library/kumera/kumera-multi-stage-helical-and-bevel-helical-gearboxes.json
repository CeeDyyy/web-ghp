The range consist of F-, G- and D-series which are optimally divided to meet the torque and ratio requirements. All the sizes are available in helical and bevel-helical versions and can be equipped with either solid or hollow output shaft. The modular structure of the gearboxes has enabled the installation of additional equipment onto the gearbox. Thus a single gearbox can be transformed into a variety of applications and mounting arrangements."
