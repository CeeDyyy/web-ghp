            "The Covera series is designed especially for non-continuous operation. Thanks to its concave – convex tooth profile it can take higher impacts and loads than conventional spur or worm gears. The reason why Covera tooth profile is stronger than a conventional worm tooth profile is that the surface pressure is spread onto a larger area causing a significant surface pressure drop.",
            "The ratio scale from 5:1 to 3550:1 gives the user room to choose from. Whether you needed a worm gearbox to an anode jacking system, bark removal process, mixer or, for example, a feeder, you can find a suitable Covera gearbox from our product portfolio. Covera gearboxes are made to meet even the roughest requirements."
