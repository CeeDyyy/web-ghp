            "Kumera Active Drive™ Girth Gear ensures optimal load distribution on girth gear teeth throughout the years of operation without a need for high accuracy alignment. This compact solution utilizes the full load capacity of the valuable girth ring while providing maximum usability and serviceability with minimum space requirements.",
            "Kumera Active Drive™ independently optimizes the tooth contact by constantly modifying the alignment of the drive unit. This enables girth gear load ratings that are unachievable for conventional drives.",
            "The range includes 10 gearbox sizes, which are optimally divided to meet required torque ranges and ratio requirements.",
            "The mounting procedure takes less time than ever before while the foot can be directly cast to the base concrete without separate steel structures for adjustment. Kumera Active Drive™ will correct the alignment of the pinion and backlash can be adjusted effortlessly by rotating a single screw."
