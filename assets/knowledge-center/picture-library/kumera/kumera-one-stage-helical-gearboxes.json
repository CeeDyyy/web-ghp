            "Kumera LX-gearbox series is specifically designed for fast rotating shafts such as roll applications. The range includes 16 gear unit sizes which are optimally divided to meet required torque ranges and ratio requirements. Integrated lubrication canals and gear wheels manufactured with high accuracy have resulted in compact dimensions with a high torque range from 1 to 400 kNm. Maintenance-free labyrinth seals are integrated into the gearbox housing. Labyrinth seals cause neither wear nor friction on the rotating shaft. The gearbox can be easily connected to a central lubrication system or gearboxes can be delivered with a separate lubrication unit."
